# packetmap

**packetmap**  is a C# application for performing IP-to-country lookups of internet traffic, and then lighting that country up on a map of the world.

## Why would anyone want to do that  ?

From memory, I'd watched a James Bond movie and thought it'd be cool. 

Before people started using CDNs you could see where websites were hosted, and it looked particularly exciting any time you torrented something.

It doesn't make those high-pitched squiddly-beep noises yet.

## How do I use it

You could download it, compile it, and see what happens, but wouldn't be surprised if it no longer works. 

The geoip database is definitely out of date, so you'll  probably have to update that from the free maxmind one at https://www.maxmind.com/en/home
